PART TIME PHP WP-PLUGIN-DEV
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Martin4Crypto
- I have BSC in materials engineering and have a day job.
- I would like to write some code during my free time that is 15 hours a week.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general but I found out that there are infinite coding styles and many languages out there.
- At first, I leaned C++ and CLRS algorithm on university, and then HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, and PHP online on w3schools.com 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning WordPress plugin development cause I thought that's the easiest way to get results out of a code.   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are being leaded by PHP experts so that I can also learn. Or any projects with expert leaders.
- And by that I mean whether you should teach me or pay me. 
- By the way I know the basics of PHP and OOP coding with it, but I have problem with dependency injections without pre-built containers (laravel developing seems to be more rational in this sense comparing to WordPress.)
- 📫 So, if you are an expert WordPress plugin developer please challenge me by asking me to develop a plugin for you as a practice and then review my coding skills.
-  I work for crypto to save it, Or my code being reviewed by php experts or getting better dependency injection boilerplates for WP development.
